# Port range for app ports (one random free port per app in this range). The install script opens this range in the firewall so IP:port access works without adding each port manually. Prefer using a domain so nginx proxies and only 80/443 are used.
APP_PORT_MIN=3001
APP_PORT_MAX=3100

SESSION_SECRET=change-me-to-a-random-string
# Set PANEL_HTTPS=1 only if the panel is served over HTTPS (so the session cookie is sent only on HTTPS)
# PANEL_HTTPS=0

# Base path for cloned app repos (must be writable by panel process)
APPS_BASE_PATH=/var/www/upgs-node-apps

# Nginx directory for app vhosts (panel writes upgs-node-app-<id>.conf here; installer uses /etc/nginx/upgs-node-apps.d so the panel user can write)
NGINX_APPS_CONF_DIR=/etc/nginx/upgs-node-apps.d
# Nginx binary path (use this if "nginx" is not in PATH when the panel runs, e.g. under systemd)
# NGINX_BIN=/usr/sbin/nginx
# Email for Let's Encrypt (used when panel obtains SSL certs automatically for app domains)
# LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=admin@example.com

# NVM path (e.g. ~/.nvm for the user running the panel, or /root/.nvm when run as root)
NVM_DIR=/root/.nvm

# PM2 home (must match the shell's pm2 so panel-managed apps show in `pm2 list`; e.g. ~/.pm2 or /root/.pm2)
PM2_HOME=/root/.pm2

# Optional: skip PAM auth (dev only; set to 1 to accept any username/password)
# SKIP_PAM=0
