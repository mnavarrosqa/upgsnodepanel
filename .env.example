# Port range for app ports (one random free port per app in this range). The install script opens this range in the firewall so IP:port access works without adding each port manually. Prefer using a domain so nginx proxies and only 80/443 are used.
APP_PORT_MIN=3001
APP_PORT_MAX=3100

SESSION_SECRET=change-me-to-a-random-string
# Set PANEL_HTTPS=1 only if the panel is served over HTTPS (so the session cookie is sent only on HTTPS)
# PANEL_HTTPS=0

# Base path for cloned app repos (must be writable by panel process)
APPS_BASE_PATH=/var/www/upgs-node-apps

# Nginx directory for app vhosts (panel writes upgs-node-app-<id>.conf here; must be included by nginx, e.g. conf.d)
NGINX_APPS_CONF_DIR=/etc/nginx/conf.d
# Nginx binary path (use this if "nginx" is not in PATH when the panel runs, e.g. under systemd)
# NGINX_BIN=/usr/sbin/nginx

# NVM path (usually /root/.nvm when running as root)
NVM_DIR=/root/.nvm

# PM2 home (must match the shell's pm2 so panel-managed apps show in `pm2 list`)
PM2_HOME=/root/.pm2

# Optional: skip PAM auth (dev only; set to 1 to accept any username/password)
